# Keyboard Controller
LF2 is a keyboard figher type of game, that the keyboard controller must feel "rigid" and "reactive" to players. In technical terms, it should be reliable and responsive. The requirements are:

- never drop keys
- respond in a guaranteed time frame
- eliminate repeated keys caused by long-pressing a key

F.core `controller` and `combodec` provides a system meeting all the above requirements. For more information, consult [F.core/controller](http://tyt2y3.github.io/F.core/docs/docs.html#controller).

The respond time is always smaller than one time unit (TU). Keyboard inputs received during the course of a TU is buffered, and processed at the end of the TU, when `combo` event occurs. If a valid combo is detected, it may cause a frame transition, and changes will take place at the next TU.
