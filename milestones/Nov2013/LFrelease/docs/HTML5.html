# HTML5 technology
features survey and usage

## Requirements
The officially supported browsers are latest Chrome, Firefox and IE. F.LF is tested in each of these browsers before release. Legacy browser versions will not be supported. Under the current state of the art, Chrome gives the best performance, with IE10 the second, and Firefox sometimes lag.

### distribution
F.LF will be distributed online and offline.
#### online
When played online, F.LF should loads instantly following a lazy loading scheme, by loading only what is needed and until it is needed.
#### offline
F.LF should be able to run as a standalone application offline, without the need of a local HTTP server.

### Flash
If possible, HTML5 features should be used. Flash fallback is not necessary, and should be avoided at all costs.

## Graphics
PNG with transparency is well supported by all browsers. Image rotation, scaling and mirror is also well supported.

## Graphics (DOM vs Canvas)
One of the most asked questions is why DOM is employed instead of Canvas in F.LF. Here is a long explanation. It starts from the requirement of a render engine:

##### z-ordering
in CSS, z-ordering is native and easy. in canvas, a z sorting alogrithm is needed.
##### lazy rendering
in DOM, only the changed part is re-rendered when needed. in canvas, the whole scene has to be re-rendered every frame.
##### viewport clipping
in CSS, viewport clipping can be done by `overflow:hidden` and browsers already optimized clipping very well. in canvas, viewport clipping is hard to implement manually.
##### local coordinate system
in CSS, `position:relative` gives advanced, infinite level hierarchical coordinate system. in canvas, a scene graph have to be implemented manually.
##### CSS positioning
in CSS, many positioning operators (floating, align, margin, etc) are available. in canvas, either the coordinates have to be hard coded or a layout system have to be implemented manually.
##### hardware acceleration
DOM animation is slow, that *was* true a few years ago. Today, Webkit and IE has excellent hardware acceleration for CSS 3d transform, making DOM animation (nearly) as fast as Canvas.

#### Summary
In summary, Canvas is fast because it is low level. But F.LF requires a high level render engine. All the features have to be implemented on top of Canvas, and it will take a lot of effort. Still, it is unsure whether a javascript render engine on top of Canvas will be faster than the existing C++ render engine in browsers. Browser engineers have already spent a lot of effort in optimizing and accelerating DOM performance, the improvements over the past few years is huge and clearly benchmarked. Project F developers will concentrate on game engine development, and there are really enough challenges. But once again, F.LF always welcome hacks and contributions.

> ##### More on performance benchmarks
It is always debatable on different types of benchmarks and their implications. One type is application benchmark where real world applications are run and measured. Another type is micro benchmark, where only a small subset of functionalities are tested (say floating point operations or matrix inverse). Micro benchmarks are cheap to produce because of their simplicity, that they are too optimized for particular operations and can hardly capture the performance characteristics of real world applications. On the other hand, application benchmarks are hard to obtain, that decisions have to be made before the actual applications are developed.
> 
> The best strategy is to take the path of least effort, and only invest effort when something is proven too slow.

#### Update
There are some really good graphics engine on top of Canvas out there, powerful enough and proven to be fast, for example KineticJS and CreateJS. It will be fairer if we can compare DOM to them directly.

## Sound
Flash actually has a very good sound playback performance and functionality. HTML5 sound works **A**cross **A**ll **M**ajor **B**rowsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE) (AAMB), but does not support multi-burst (or whatever you call it, the same sound being played overlapped at different times). The quirk is, Firefox refuses to support patented MP3 and IE refuses to support free OGG. The work around is:

1. create multiple objects of each sound (one object multi instance does not work, but multi object multi instance does)
2. have 2 formats (MP3 and OGG) of each sound

## Local storage
Local storage works AAMB in HTTP. Only in IE, local storage does not work locally (`C:\`) because of security convention. That's why cookie is still needed to emulate local storage.

## JSON loading
JSON loading works AAMB in HTTP in same origin, but not locally. The only way to load data files locally is to load files as `.js`, which magically works across origin. Though javascript loading is less secure, this will be the only way until Cross Origin JSON arrived.

## Web socket
Flash actually has a quite good socket interface. Web socket is still preliminary, though many example applications are already developed. Socket.io is a nice abstraction library. Socket functionality is vital to multiplayer gaming. But F.LF has a long roadmap, which multiplayer will not be reached soon.
