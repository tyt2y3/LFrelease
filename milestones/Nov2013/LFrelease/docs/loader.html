### Reference

loader is a requirejs plugin that loads content packages. the specification of F.LF content packages is defined in [package](package.html)

## Usage

```
requirejs(['LF/loader!anystring'],function(){...});
```

## mechanism

#### 1 package listing
`LF/packages.js` is first loaded. packages.js should define a list of available content packages, as in the following structure
```
{
	//"package name": { path:"path/to/package" }
	"LF2 1.451": { path:"LFrelease/LF2_19" }
}
```
(unimplemented) if there are multiple packages, let the user choose which to load

#### 2 load package
`manifest.js` under the package directory is loaded and checked against the schema.

#### 2.1 load data
load the specified data list, typically named `data.js`.

##### lazy loading
if global.lazyload is defined, a function `load()` is inserted to `package.data.object` 
with the following use:
```
function load
(ID,    //array of object IDs to load,
ready)  //callback when all requested files are loaded
{
	//the function is async
}
```

every object defined in the array `object` by `data.js` will be passed to `global.lazyload`, and `global.lazyload` shall return `true` if it wants to __not__ load the data file at this moment. the `data` property of that object will then be marked `'lazy'` in this case. if `global.lazyload` returns falsy or `global.lazyload` is not defined, the data file will be loaded immediately, and the `data` property of that object will contain the structure defined by the js file `file`. other properties defined by `data.js` are copied as is.

later, if the data files are wanted, one should call for example
```
package.data.object.load([1,2], //wants to load object with id 1 and 2
function ()
{
	//all data is ready now
});
```

in the scenario of F.LF, character data files are not loaded during startup, and are only being loaded when a match starts, only if that characters are being selected.

#### 2.2 load properties
load the specified properties file, typically named `properties.js`.

#### 2.3 load resourcemap
if defined, load the specified resourcemap, typically named `resourcemap.js`.

#### return
the loader plugin is __blocking__, and will only return when all data files are loaded. the returned structure is like:
```
package:
{
	data:
	{
		object: [
			{id:30, type:'character', data:{...}},
			...
		],
		background:[
			...
		],
		...
	}
	properties:
	{
		...
	},
	resourcemap:
	{
		...
	},
	location: '../../LFrelease/LF2_19/' //location of the package relative to the html file
}
```
