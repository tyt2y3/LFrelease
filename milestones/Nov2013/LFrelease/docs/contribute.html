## before you start
do you

- love LF2, once played day and night?
	> necessary
- (think you) understand LF2?
	> data changing experience will help. but it turns out that to _develop_, any previous knowledge does not seem to be sufficient
- have some programming skills?
	> certain skills in javascript is required to develop. but no programming is required to test or write test cases

### development environment

- programming text editor
	> I recommend [geany](http://www.geany.org/) and [geany portable for windows](http://geanyportable.org/)
- [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
	> for building demo
- [git](http://git-scm.com/)
- [optional] [console2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/console/)
	> [configuration](configuration.html#console2), only to make the git console looks better
- repositories
	 - [github help/fork-a-repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
	 - fork [F.core](https://github.com/tyt2y3/F.core), [F.LF](https://github.com/tyt2y3/F.LF) and [LFrelease](https://github.com/tyt2y3/LFrelease). The three repositories must be named and placed as below:

```
 F
 |---F.core
 |---LF
 |---LFrelease
```

## what to do
- read more, understanding the
	- [development](develop.html)
	- [project](project.html)
- collect fine grained data of frame transition sequences from LF2, and [write test cases](unit_test_suite.html)
- play around with [latest demo](../demo/index.html), find a bug, and [report](https://github.com/tyt2y3/F.LF/issues?state=open) or fix it.
- pick a feature from the [roadmap](develop.html#roadmap) to investigate
