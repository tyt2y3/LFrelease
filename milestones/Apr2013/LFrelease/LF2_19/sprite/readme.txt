The original images are indexed bmp, having the right tool ( I use mtPaint), the color map can be preserved after conversion to indexed png. do not use 32bit/24bit format, instead use indexed mode and sets the transparency index, this strategy can compress files to the smallest size, about half of compressed bmp.
